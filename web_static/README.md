# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

![Workflow](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/concepts/74/hbnb_step1.png)

## HTML / CSS
## Background Context

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything
During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you tofix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.
